Model Selection
Implemented SVD for collaborative filtering, which is specifically suited for recommendation systems by handling missing values and optimizing for recommendation tasks.

Feature Selection
Performed feature selection using filter methods to enhance model performance.

Unsupervised Learning
Explored unsupervised learning techniques, specifically SVD.

Netflix Recommendation System Project
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
SVD is a matrix factorization technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset, making it a powerful tool for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems.


SVD reduces the space dimension from N-dimension to K-dimension.
It is used in collaborative filtering to recommend items based on user-item interactions.
Datasets
Movies Datasets: Information about movies
Rating Datasets: User ratings for movies
Merge Datasets: Combined information for analysis
Popular and Liked Genres
Identified the most popular and liked genres based on user ratings.

Personalized Movie Recommendations
Created a model to recommend the best-suited movie for users in every genre.

Best and Worst Rated Genres
Analyzed genres to determine which received the best and worst ratings based on user feedback.
