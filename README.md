# Netflix Data Analysis and Recommendations

This project focuses on analyzing the Netflix dataset to gain insights into viewing patterns and build recommendation models. The dataset includes various features such as movie titles, genres, ratings, and user preferences. The goal is to explore the data, develop predictive models, and provide recommendations.
This project using machine learning techniques, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), for collaborative filtering.

# ðŸ›  Skills
Python, Machine Learning, Data Visualization (AutoViz), SVD

## ðŸ”­ Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and distribution of the data, and identify key features that influence viewing habits.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that could improve the predictive power of the recommendation models.
- **Model Building**: Develop and train machine learning models to recommend movies.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and refine them for better accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to showcase the insights and results of the analysis.

## ðŸ“„ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Netflix and includes information on various aspects of movie viewing, such as:
- Movie titles
- Genres
- User ratings
- Viewing history
- User preferences
- Other relevant features
